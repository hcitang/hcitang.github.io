**Note:** As of August 2022, I am a visiting professor at the [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/)

I am an Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Information](http://ischool.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca). I direct the [RICELab (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) research group](http://ricelab.github.io/). Previously, I was an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/) at the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca/).

My current research explores the design, implementation and evaluation of novel systems for:
* mixed reality interfaces for collaboration and learning,
* prototyping ubiquitous computing environments,
* interfaces for AI/robot supported activity, and
* electronic fashion as a means of expression.

Broadly, I am interested in User Experience Design, Human-Computer Interaction, and the sub-disciplines of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Ubiquitous Computing.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, watching cooking videos on YouTube, watching movies, and running after my kid.

In my previous life (i.e. before kiddo), I was an avid video game player, volleyball player (in real life), and aspired to be an awesome programmer.
